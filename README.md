## âš¡ Fun fact

Here's a fun fact about me: I'm a Rubik's Cube enthusiast, skilled at solving it quickly. 
Beyond that, I'm fluent in four languages (English, Malayalam, Tamil, Hindi) also learning japansese 
as a foriegn language and I hail from Kerala, where we have the vibrant art forms like Kathakali, Mohiniyattam,
and Theyyam, its delicious cuisine like appam, stew, and seafood specialties, along with its serene backwaters and lush greenery. 
In my free time, I enjoy diving into books, particularly stories and biographies. 
As an anime fan, I'm always exploring new series. 
My ultimate goal is to become an expert in various tech fields, 
including Coding, Ethical hacking, Networking, AI, and Robotics.
